My name is Chris and I work on the web. Some things I am and have been

- Champion for adding [Decorators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) to JavaScript
- Lead frontend engineer at [Bitski](https://www.bitski.com/)
- [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) core team member
- Former frontend engineer at [LinkedIn](linkedin.com), [Addepar](https://addepar.com/),
  Ticketfly (now [EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/))
- Maintainer of far too many NPM packages

Outside of work I'm an amateur chef (I make a mean stew), a sci-fi/spec-fic enthusiast (with
dreams of one day writing my own), a board game connoisseur (maybe one day I'll find a D&D group),
a budding pixel artist (<span title="I can't take full credit, I started with a design from someone on fiverr (@nghuijing), but I did modify it quite a bit to get the final look and feel. The dog was also all me!">as seen in the top left<span class="text-ochre-500">\*</span></span>),
and a dabbler in exploring the great outdoors (I summitted a mountain once, that was pretty cool).

I'm also a dog dad, and head over heels for my partner Liz ❤️.

I firmly believe that black lives matter, gender is fluid (I would know a bit about that), all
human beings are valid, and justice is not just unless it's for everyone. My pronouns are
he/him/they/them. Slava Ukraini.

If you want to get in touch, you can DM me on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@pzura:matrix.org).
